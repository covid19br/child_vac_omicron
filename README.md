# A model of children vaccination during the Omicron wave in Brazil

## Important functions
 - rodar_no_cluster.R contains the parallel algorithm that runs the model
 - sensitivity_analysis*.R contains the functions to generate the samples from distributions
 - solve_model_reinfec.R contains the basic models

One might follow rodar_no_cluster.R to understand the workflow.

Eventually we will organize this README and clean the repository from legacy functions.
